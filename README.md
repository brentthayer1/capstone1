Capstone 1 Project for Galvanize Data Science Immersive

## Topics:
- How have the qualities of a song changed through the decades?
- Can these qualities be quantified, and could this be applied to song writing techniques to achieve the status of a 'Hit' song?

## Description:
- I am curious as to how songs can be vectorized and analyzed to look for trends and formulate a way to predict the success of a song on Spotify.


## Data Source
- This is a dataset which was obtained using Spotify's web API.  This dataset was discovered on Kaggle, and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortytwo102/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset "Title")


## Data Description
- This data is organized by decade, from 1960 - 2019.  This data has no information on plays, streams, or units sold.
